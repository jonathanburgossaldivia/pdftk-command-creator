# PDFTK command generator
Semi-automatic pdftk command generator

Assemble pages from the input PDFs to create a new PDF. PDFTK merges pages of a PDF or splits PDF pages of documents. The order of the pages in the new PDF is specified by the order of the given page ranges. The page ranges will be created according to their regular expression. 

Assuming you have a 6 page scanned document with OCR and its regular expression is to search for dates, in case on page 1 you find a date and the next different date is on page 4 then the list of commands generated by the program It would look like this:


```
pdftk my_original.pdf cat 1-3 output a_date1_my_original.pdf
pdftk my_original.pdf cat 4-6 output a_date2_my_original.pdf
```
